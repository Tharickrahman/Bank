 â€” Static banking website

Files:
- index.html (Home)
- home1.html (Home 1 variant)
- about.html
- services.html

How to open:
Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click in File Explorer or open with your browser). No server required for basic testing.

Notes:
- The contact form stores submissions in localStorage for demo purposes.
- Testimonials rotate automatically on the Home and Home 1 pages via vanilla JavaScript.

Updates in this version:
- Hero sections use static background images (no automatic sliding).
- Testimonials expanded to include multiple customer quotes and rotate on both Home pages.
- Added extra content sections: Features, Stats (on Home) and Offers details (on Home 1).
- Enhanced background gradients and color palette for a cleaner look.
- The site uses a dark theme by default and includes an expanded footer (links, contact info, newsletter demo).

- Add real backend for contact submissions
- Replace placeholder copy and images with real marketing content
- Add more accessibility and tests
